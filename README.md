1. CSV-to-Text-for-Iramuteq-25-04-2022.ipynb Makes Iramuteq outputs.  The main line/cell of interest is the one headed '#option 5: split by companies'.  That's where the full list could be shortened etc.
2. Topics_from_csv_25_04_2022.ipynb.  Does Gensim modelling, inc that thing where it graphs coherence values.  Not having much luck with it but maybe worth a play.
3. csv-to-bertopic-08-04-2022.ipynb.  My early attempts at using BERT which didn't go anywhere.
